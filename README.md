- Connect Ground and 5V and Data Pin of WS2812 to D5 Pin to the ESP8266
- Copy wordclock.yaml and wordclock.h into /config/esphome directory 
- Using esphome GUI you can flash wordclock.yaml to an esp8266

## Home Assistant integration:
Add the esphome to your Home Assistant instance.
You should now see the Dummy Light "Wordclock", which allows you to controll the brightness and color of the Wordclock.
Additionaly there is a service esphome.wordclock_setled, which allow you to set color to individual LEDS (e.g. the status icons)
This Service takes: number (PIN Number of LED, see above), red (0-255), green (0-255), blue (0-255)
```
service: esphome.wordclock_setled
data:
  number: 115
  green: 0
  red: 255
  blue: 0
```
